# Description
This is a small, console based ASCII game I created during my first week of learning C++.
It features a player ('P') running along a grid, collecting objects ('O' for score, '+' for lives), while dodging bombs ('B')

This project greatly exceeded its original scope, but it taught me a lot about threading and mutex, along with basic 2d game logic.
Im excited to translate this into a real 2d game using a graphics engine such as SFML

# To Compile
- The provided Makefile compiles everything into its own object file, linking to create **./ascii_game.exe**
- Can use make clean to get rid of the .o files

# To Run
Assuming you used the provided makefile, **./ascii_game.out**
